state, U.S. federal, or international level may adversely affect the minting,
use, transfer, redemption and/or value of USD1, and impose restrictions on
issuers and other parties. Depending on jurisdiction and structure, stablecoins
may be classified as securities, commodities, or other regulated instruments,
subjecting USD1 and related entities and persons to additional licensing and
compliance obligations. BitGo or the WLFI Parties may be required to obtain
money transmitter licenses, e-money licenses, or other regulatory approvals in
one or more jurisdictions, and failure to secure or maintain these licenses
could severely impact our operations and the minting, use, transfer, redemption
and/or value of USD1. You are responsible for complying with all applicable law
related to your use, purchase, transfer, holding, redemption or other
disposition of USD1. You agree that you are solely responsible for determining
whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including tax laws. You
are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use
of USD1 including any accurate reporting of the tax or legal status of USD1 in
your jurisdiction.34:["$","p",null,{"children":"$51"}]
35:["$","h2",null,{"children":"We reserve the right to block and freeze USD1

addresses and, if such addresses are USD1 custodied addresses, freeze associated
USD1 (temporarily or permanently) that BitGo determines, in its sole discretion,
are associated with illegal activity or activity that otherwise violates the
applicable USD1 terms. In the event that you send USD1 to such a blocked
address, or receive USD1 from a blocked address, BitGo may freeze such USD1 and
take steps to terminate your USD1 Account. In certain circumstances, BitGo or
WLFI Parties may deem it necessary to report such suspected illegal activity to
applicable law enforcement agencies and you may forfeit any rights associated
with your USD1, including the ability to redeem USD1 for U.S. Dollars. BitGo or
WLFI Parties may also be forced to freeze USD1 and/or surrender associated
reserves in the event any party receives a legal order from a valid government
authority requiring it to do so. BitGo or WLFI Parties reserve the right to
block the transfer of USD1 to and from any address on

USD1 is sent to a third party USD1 address, such transaction is irreversible,
and neither BitGo nor the WLFI Parties will have the ability to reverse or
recall any transaction once initiated. Sending USD1 to another address
automatically transfers and assigns to that USD1 holder, and to any subsequent
holder, the right to redeem USD1 for U.S. Dollar. A non-exhaustive list of
examples of possible risks and losses may include: (i) an address may have been
entered incorrectly and the true owner of the address may never be discovered,
(ii) you may not have (or subsequently lose) the private key associated with
such address, (iii) an address may belong to an entity that will not return the
USD1, or (iv) an address belongs to an entity that may return the USD1 but first
requires action on your part, such as verification of your identity. Losses due
to accidental or fraudulent transactions may not be recoverable. You alone bear
all responsibility for any losses that might be incurred as a result of sending
USD1 to an incorrect or unintended USD1
address.38:["$","p",null,{"children":"$53"}]

risk of operational challenges. USD1 and the related entities and parties may

operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to the
issuance, redemption, or transfer of USD1. You understand that the USD1 related
services may experience security breaches or operational issues, which could
lead to delays in redeeming USD1 or loss of funds. Employees, contractors, or
integrated service providers may inadvertently or maliciously compromise the
system or expose vulnerabilities. USD1 issuance and redemptions may rely on
smart contracts, which are subject to bugs, exploits, or malicious attacks.
Interruptions in platform services, blockchain network congestion, or downtime
can affect users ability to transact and redeem USD1, impacting credibility and
utility. You agree to accept the risk of USD1 transaction failure resulting from

value and utility of USD1. Continued adoption may depend on exchanges, market
makers, businesses and others deciding to support USD1. However, such adoption
could be limited for a number of reasons, including without limitation,
litigation or regulatory activity, adverse media attention, political
perceptions or developments, the use of USD1 for illicit or objectionable ends
